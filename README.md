Firstly, We copied those data from the <a href="https://www.iedcr.gov.bd/">IEDCR</a> webpage. Then, We stored it in <a href="https://thingspeak.com">ThingSpeak</a>. we stored there so that we can find those data very easily. For each data, we created each Thingspeak each API. And also we need to ensure the internet for running those processes.  I am giving those API Key below:
