A project of Corona Live stats using GET command and esp8266 module from https://www.iedcr.gov.bd/

Firstly, We copied those data from <a href="https://www.iedcr.gov.bd/">IEDCR</a> webpage. Then, I stored it <a href="https://thingspeak.com">ThingSpeak</a> . we stored there bacause we can find those data very easily.For each data we created each Thingspeak each API. And also we need ensure internet for running those process. I have given those API to below:
